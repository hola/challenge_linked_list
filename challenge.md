# JS Linked List Challenge

There are very few really great programmers, and we'd like to give them a chance to prove it to the world, and get a nice prize in return!

## The challenge: generalize NodeJS's linklist
NodeJS has a very high performance, low-memory overhead implementation of a linked list: https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/_linklist.js.

This implementation is specific (idle items only), and does not allow list parent to hold two or more different lists in the parent list object.

Your challenge is to make it generic, while not reducing performance, and include tests to show that performance hasn’t been degraded.

The fastest, most efficient, most generic implementation wins the prize!

## Rules
* Send your solution to meytal@hola.org. Last date for submission is **June 30, 2015**.
* Winners will be announced on **July 10** on this page.
* Solutions should not be publicized until the contest ends and winners are announced. Solutions made public before **June 30** will be rejected.
* JavaScript implementation used for benchmarking is V8
* Each contestant may submit multiple submissions and solutions, and submit additional improvements until the closure date. The best out of those submissions will be selected.
* You may submit more than one submission.

## Prizes
* 1st prize: $1500
* 2nd prize: $1000
* 3rd prize: $500
* Most original prize: $350. Will be granted to the most creative, original solution that will achieve amazing performance using out of the box, wild, or non-standard ideas.
* EXTRA!! If you know of a great programmer that you think can win, invite them to take the challenge by email, and copy challengejs@hola.org on that email. If your friend wins, we’ll double-up and send you the winning amount as well!

## Why are we doing this
If you are a truly great programmer, we’d like to know you, and to get a chance to tell you more about us. If interested, we'll invite you for an interview.
