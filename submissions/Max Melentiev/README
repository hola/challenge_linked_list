There are three implementations of linked list:

- First I've made OOP implementation (linked_list file).
It was good enough, but a little bit slower than original _linklist.
It's interface differs from original and there are methods
for compatibility. There is #push method, it only works with elements that
don't belong to list yet. It's performance is same as original #append (sometimes
slightly slower). Fully compatible #append method is 3-4 times slower than
original.
This is my final implementation. After it I've made some tries but they weren't faster.

- Then I've made implementation (linked_list_harmony file) using WeakMap
(for ECMAScript 2015 mode), but it was much slower than original.

- Then I've tried procedural style (linked_list_proc file), but it is also
not so fast.


Code is written in CoffeeScript, compiled files are also included.

To run benchmarks:

- Install benchmark.js with:
  $ npm install

- Run benchmark with:
  $ node benchmark/linked_list.js
